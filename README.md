# CStinky  
### A Gamified Personal Hygiene Planner

Have you ever heard the joke that students from a certain major (CS 👀) never shower?  
Have you ever gone past someone and felt like your nose was attacked?

That’s why we built **CStinky**.

## What is CStinky?

**CStinky** is a fun, judgment-free personal hygiene planner for busy students and developers.

When deadlines pile up and sleep becomes optional, hygiene is often the first thing to be forgotten.  
Many argue:

> “Einstein didn't care much about hygiene either.”

But here's the thing:  
You aren't Einstein, and Einstein didn't become a genius because he didn't shower.

CStinky helps those *“Einstein followers”* build simple hygiene habits — with **humor, streaks, and forgiveness**.

No guilt.  
No lectures.  
Just gentle reminders.
